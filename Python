# You have to "import" built in functions like random. Do this at the top
import random

# This is how a module/function definition looks. Parameters can go in the parentheses when needed
def main():

  # This will print "hello world"
  print('hello world')
  
  # Let's define a variable and make it a random number fromn 1 to 10
  random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
  
# Calling a module/function is easy!
main()
